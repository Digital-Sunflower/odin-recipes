    <p> Here is yummy baked version of Eggplant Parmesan!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggplant, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch slices</li>

              <li>1 tablespoon salt, or as needed</li> 
                
              <li> 1 cup Italian-style bread crumbs</li> 
                
              <li> ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li> 

              <li> 2 eggs, beaten</li> 
                
              <li> 1 (28 ounce) jar garlic-and-tomato pasta sauce</li> 
                
              <li> ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li> 
                
              <li> 1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese, or as needed</li> 
                
              <li> ½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        </ul>
    
     <h2> Directions: </h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Place eggplant slices in a colander; sprinkle both sides of each slice with salt. Allow to sit for at least 3 hours. Wipe excess moisture from eggplant slices with paper towels. </li>

         <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
            
            <li>  Mix bread crumbs and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese together in a shallow bowl. Beat eggs in a separate shallow bowl.</li>
            
                <li>  Dip eggplant slices in beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat both sides; arrange coated eggplant slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned and crisp, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
            
                        <li> Cover the bottom of a 9x13-inch casserole dish with a layer of pasta sauce; top with a layer of eggplant slices. Sprinkle with about 1 tablespoon of the remaining Parmesan cheese and 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers with remaining ingredients, ending with a cheese layer. Sprinkle with basil.</li>
            
                            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and golden brown, about 35 minutes.</li>
         </ol>
